## My process

This entire project was a learning process, I used it as a way to teach myself react during my freetime. I began by researching how to create react projects on youtube, stack overflow and many specialized sources, too many to list, to get the project off the ground and help guide me through development. The rest was simply using my previous experience in web development to craft and shape the site over time.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - React Page Router
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For JS based styles

### What I learned

I learned how to use the react library, as well as many useful 3rd party tools that helped make me not want to pull my hair out and go bald before 30.

### Continued development

I would like to work on some simpler react projects to help hammer in the foundations. This project was fun, but probably a lot for my first time using this library. Unfortunately, I favor the deepend mentality.
